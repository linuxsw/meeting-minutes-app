## Steps to Execute

Implementing the AI-Enhanced Meeting Minutes Generator involves the following key steps:

1.  **Preparation & Planning**:
    *   **Identify Stakeholders**: Define key stakeholders from IT, business units, and potential user groups.
    *   **Gather Specific Requirements**: Confirm specific template needs, output format preferences, and integration requirements (e.g., authentication, document storage).
    *   **Secure Resources**: Allocate server resources (if hosting internally) or choose a cloud hosting provider. Obtain necessary API keys for commercial AI providers (OpenAI, Together AI) if required.
    *   **Define Pilot Scope**: Select a pilot team or department for initial testing and feedback.

2.  **Deployment & Configuration**:
    *   **Choose Deployment Method**: Decide between Docker deployment (recommended for ease of setup and local AI with Ollama) or direct server installation.
    *   **Set Up Environment**: Install prerequisites (Docker/Node.js) on the chosen server or local machine.
    *   **Deploy Application**: Follow the instructions in the `SETUP_AND_USER_GUIDE.md` to deploy the application using Docker Compose or direct installation.
    *   **Configure AI Providers**: Access the application's AI Configuration page to set up desired AI providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Together AI) and enter API keys if necessary.
    *   **Integrate with Systems**: Configure integration points with document management systems or identity providers if required.

3.  **Pilot Testing & Feedback**:
    *   **Onboard Pilot Team**: Provide the pilot team with access to the application and initial guidance.
