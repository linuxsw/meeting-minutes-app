## Comparative Analysis

### Without AI Processing:
- Fast processing time
- Basic organization by speaker
- No summarization or content analysis
- Requires manual review to identify key points
- Suitable for simple transcripts or when AI processing is not desired

### With AI Processing:
- Slightly longer processing time
- Enhanced organization with topic categorization
- Automatic summarization of key points
- Extraction of action items and decisions
- Better suited for complex meetings with multiple topics

## Conclusion

The Meeting Minutes App successfully processes transcript files both with and without AI integration. The OpenAI integration significantly enhances the quality of the generated meeting minutes by providing summarization, action item extraction, and better content organization.

All previously reported issues have been fixed:
1. MIME type support for all transcript file formats
2. Transcript file persistence when navigating back
3. UI improvements for better usability
4. Text visibility in the Edit Speaker screen

The application is now ready for production use with both AI and non-AI processing options available to users.
