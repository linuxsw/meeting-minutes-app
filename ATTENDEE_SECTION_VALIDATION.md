# Attendee Section and Merged Speakers Validation

## Overview
This document provides detailed validation steps for the attendee section and merged speakers functionality in the Meeting Minutes App.

## 1. Merged Speakers Functionality

### Implementation Details
The processing page has been updated to ensure that when speakers are merged:
- All segments from both speakers are combined under the target speaker
- The source speaker is removed from the speakers list
- The merged state is preserved when navigating to the result page
- The merged speaker appears correctly in the attendee section

### Validation Steps
1. Upload a VTT file with multiple speakers
2. On the processing page, drag one speaker onto another to merge them
3. Verify that the source speaker disappears and its segments are added to the target speaker
4. Click "Continue to Generate Minutes"
5. Confirm that the merged speaker appears correctly in the attendee section

## 2. Add Participants Button

### Implementation Details
The result page has been enhanced with an "Add Participants" button that:
- Is clearly visible in the attendee section header
- Opens an input field when clicked
- Allows adding new attendee names
- Adds the new attendee to the list when submitted
- Provides options to edit or remove attendees

### Validation Steps
1. After processing a transcript, navigate to the result page
2. Locate the "Add Participant" button in the attendee section header
3. Click the button to reveal the input field
4. Enter a new attendee name and click "Add"
5. Verify that the new attendee appears in the list
6. Test editing and removing attendees

## 3. Generate Minutes Integration

### Implementation Details
The Generate Minutes functionality has been updated to:
- Collect all attendees, including merged speakers and manually added participants
- Include the complete attendee list in the generated minutes
- Format attendee names properly in the output

### Validation Steps
1. After adding and merging attendees, click "Generate Minutes"
2. Verify that all attendees (original, merged, and manually added) appear in the generated minutes
3. Check that attendee names are formatted correctly

## 4. Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Implementation Details
The attendee section code includes robust error handling for:
- Empty attendee lists
- Duplicate attendee names
- Special characters in attendee names
- Very long attendee lists

### Validation Steps
1. Test with an empty transcript (no speakers)
2. Try adding an attendee with the same name as an existing one
3. Add attendees with special characters
4. Test with a large number of attendees

## 5. UI/UX Improvements

### Implementation Details
The attendee section UI has been improved with:
- Better contrast for improved readability
- Clear visual feedback for interactive elements
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Accessible controls with proper ARIA attributes

### Validation Steps
1. Verify that all text is clearly readable
2. Check that buttons and interactive elements provide visual feedback
3. Test the interface on different screen sizes
4. Validate accessibility using browser developer tools
