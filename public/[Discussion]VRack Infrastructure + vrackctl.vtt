00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:06.345
<v Seungweon Park>Oh, the error is. Yeah, the V rack.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/21-0
00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:09.785
<v Seungweon Park>You will get us the oh,
where is the V rack?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/24-0
00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:12.765
<v Seungweon Park>Why didn't come up?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/37-0
00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:19.225
<v Travis Morgan>I I think I I talked to David yesterday
before he left for vacation and.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/57-0
00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:26.941
<v Travis Morgan>It might be as simple as there's just a
step that's missing at the beginning,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/57-1
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:28.335
<v Travis Morgan>but I I don't know.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/67-0
00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:31.975
<v Travis Morgan>We would need to see the files and see if
we could recreate the problem I think.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/69-0
00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:32.865
<v Seungweon Park>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/78-0
00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:38.065
<v Seungweon Park>So this is the one that we have seen like
some error.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/112-0
00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:43.406
<v Seungweon Park>As soon as we deployed and then has the
assume error,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/112-1
00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:49.395
<v Seungweon Park>then we will see the status as the error
and then when we go inside of it and then.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/103-0
00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:46.675
<v Travis Morgan>Mm hmm.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/139-0
00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:55.803
<v Seungweon Park>This component should be installed
correctly but sometime it doesn't show</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/139-1
00:00:55.803 --> 00:00:59.955
<v Seungweon Park>any component or sometimes it shows the
component has a failure.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/149-0
00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:04.765
<v Seungweon Park>So that was the observation we send.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/151-0
00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:06.105
<v Travis Morgan>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/158-0
00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:14.255
<v Seungweon Park>OK. And also another issue is that.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/162-0
00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:16.315
<v Seungweon Park>There is the meeting.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/212-0
00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:23.343
<v Seungweon Park>The issue that I at I already addressed
this one, this one. Yeah.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/212-1
00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:29.721
<v Seungweon Park>So when we deploy once we deploy the V
rack successfully and then we've been</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/212-2
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:36.348
<v Seungweon Park>working on you know deploying to another
manually once we get into the security</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/212-3
00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:38.915
<v Seungweon Park>and and then we try to use the.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/215-0
00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:39.555
<v Seungweon Park>V rack instance.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/224-0
00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:44.105
<v Seungweon Park>For other command, sometimes we run.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/230-0
00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:48.185
<v Seungweon Park>There are certain tasks through the
pipeline somehow.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/258-0
00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:56.174
<v Seungweon Park>We just running the command and using the
VR command and then somehow they delete</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/258-1
00:01:56.174 --> 00:02:01.505
<v Seungweon Park>the V rack so that we had to recreate the
V rack stuff from the scratch.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/260-0
00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:03.585
<v Seungweon Park>I don't know what's happening but.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/298-0
00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:09.022
<v Seungweon Park>My understanding when I look at the VR
control source code,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/298-1
00:02:09.022 --> 00:02:14.297
<v Seungweon Park>the VR control code is the just a client
application and then in the server side</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/298-2
00:02:14.297 --> 00:02:19.115
<v Seungweon Park>they are just communicating with a secure
shell. So that if there is a 2.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/310-0
00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:25.425
<v Seungweon Park>Client you know concurrently they're
accessing it somehow that they tended to.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/318-0
00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:30.355
<v Seungweon Park>Some, you know,
unusual behavior happening.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/332-0
00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:35.482
<v Seungweon Park>So that's why I lost just several time
over my V rack. When I run through the,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/332-1
00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.715
<v Seungweon Park>you know, pipeline.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/335-0
00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:38.595
<v Seungweon Park>Also my another colleague.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/339-0
00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.875
<v Seungweon Park>Also, he experienced the same thing.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/372-0
00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:45.012
<v Travis Morgan>You were trying to create.
When I read this,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/372-1
00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Travis Morgan>it sounded to me like you were trying to
create a rack that already existed and it</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/372-2
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.877
<v Travis Morgan>deleted the old one when when you ran the
create operation again.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/361-0
00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:52.035
<v Seungweon Park>Yes.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/372-3
00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:57.505
<v Travis Morgan>OK and what you were saying was that
shouldn't happen if it.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/367-0
00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:54.625
<v Seungweon Park>Yeah.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/385-0
00:02:57.505 --> 00:03:00.825
<v Travis Morgan>Already there it should be like I can't
create it because there's already rack</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/385-1
00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:01.455
<v Travis Morgan>with that name.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/396-0
00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:03.665
<v Seungweon Park>Right then they need to skip it.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/391-0
00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:02.975
<v Travis Morgan>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/399-0
00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:05.505
<v Seungweon Park>But somehow they are deleting it.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/400-0
00:03:04.545 --> 00:03:05.985
<v Travis Morgan>Yeah. OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/421-0
00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:10.319
<v Travis Morgan>When when I saw David's response to you
on this,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/421-1
00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.185
<v Travis Morgan>he made it sound like that's expected
behavior. Which kind of surprised me.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/430-0
00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:18.785
<v Travis Morgan>So I'm gonna follow up with him about
that when he gets back.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/427-0
00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:17.505
<v Seungweon Park>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/438-0
00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:21.245
<v Seungweon Park>Yeah. And or is it?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/440-0
00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:23.025
<v Travis Morgan>Because because I mean not knowing.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/453-0
00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:27.065
<v Travis Morgan>Like the requirements and why it does
what it does today.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/461-0
00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:31.185
<v Travis Morgan>Like what you described to me sounds like
how we we would want it to behave.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/466-0
00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:35.025
<v Travis Morgan>So I need to touch base with him on that
one.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/476-0
00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:39.905
<v Seungweon Park>OK. And also the third you know challenge.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/487-0
00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:44.185
<v Seungweon Park>Is that somehow when we run the other
commander using the git?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/496-0
00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:46.985
<v Seungweon Park>I mean the V rack Control instance
command.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/523-0
00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:50.981
<v Seungweon Park>So there,
we'd like to know the what is the the</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/523-1
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:56.628
<v Seungweon Park>behavior of the streaming standard hour
standard error or something like that</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/523-2
00:03:56.628 --> 00:03:58.945
<v Seungweon Park>because it doesn't populate the.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/529-0
00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.745
<v Seungweon Park>I mean, there will be another topic,
but you know when?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/533-0
00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:04.675
<v Seungweon Park>They run the that command.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/568-0
00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:10.216
<v Seungweon Park>I would expect they should give the some
you know error code correctly,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/568-1
00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:15.470
<v Seungweon Park>or sometimes if it is the warning or if
it I mean not warning if it is the error</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/568-2
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.545
<v Seungweon Park>or if it is the standard output.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/585-0
00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:25.661
<v Seungweon Park>Somehow we didn't get the final result
and then sometimes they dropping the one</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/585-1
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:29.305
<v Seungweon Park>of the stream so that we don't see the.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/596-0
00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:34.555
<v Seungweon Park>That certain you know output from the
commander. We are running with.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/616-0
00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:40.833
<v Seungweon Park>It so that will be the another challenge
and also I mean as you know it doesn't</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/616-1
00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:43.945
<v Seungweon Park>support the other real time of the output.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/633-0
00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:48.676
<v Seungweon Park>So which will be a little bit challenging
in terms of implementation as well as I</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/633-1
00:04:48.676 --> 00:04:49.705
<v Seungweon Park>experience before.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/648-0
00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:55.083
<v Seungweon Park>So you'll be really nice to have a little
improvement in the actual, you know,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/648-1
00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:56.785
<v Seungweon Park>streaming of the command.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/649-0
00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:56.535
<v Travis Morgan>Is this?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/674-0
00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:02.977
<v Travis Morgan>Is this really coming up when? OK,
so let me repeat back what I heard.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/674-1
00:05:02.977 --> 00:05:07.465
<v Travis Morgan>So the text streaming coming out of the
command line interface is is.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/675-0
00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:08.325
<v Seungweon Park>Right pichu.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/677-0
00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:09.785
<v Travis Morgan>Sorry.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/704-0
00:05:10.505 --> 00:05:13.744
<v Seungweon Park>Oh yeah,
the command line which we feed inside of</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/704-1
00:05:13.744 --> 00:05:17.241
<v Seungweon Park>the command,
like using running the SM command inside</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/704-2
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:18.665
<v Seungweon Park>of the Gateway or LRU.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/705-0
00:05:18.895 --> 00:05:19.135
<v Travis Morgan>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/707-0
00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:20.105
<v Seungweon Park>So in that case.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/726-0
00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:24.249
<v Travis Morgan>When when you are connected to the
command line to the gateway or whatever,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/726-1
00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:27.301
<v Travis Morgan>and you're running a command,
the standard out streaming is not</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/726-2
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:27.825
<v Travis Morgan>consistent.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/729-0
00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:28.855
<v Seungweon Park>Right.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/732-0
00:05:29.175 --> 00:05:29.695
<v Travis Morgan>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/754-0
00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:33.290
<v Travis Morgan>And that's mainly a concern when you are
is that a concern,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/754-1
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.922
<v Travis Morgan>no matter what you're doing?
Or is this mainly like when your</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/754-2
00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:40.495
<v Travis Morgan>pipeline's executing and you can't tell
what's happening or?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/778-0
00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:45.614
<v Seungweon Park>Even when I run through the command line
from the my terminal,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/764-0
00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:44.975
<v Travis Morgan>Huh.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/778-1
00:05:45.614 --> 00:05:48.995
<v Seungweon Park>you know so that they can, you know,
communicate it.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/770-0
00:05:46.255 --> 00:05:46.335
<v Travis Morgan>Uh.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/817-0
00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:53.956
<v Seungweon Park>So even I face the other kind of a issue
even in the, you know,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/787-0
00:05:52.045 --> 00:05:52.445
<v Travis Morgan>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/817-1
00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:58.607
<v Seungweon Park>the pipeline is the Oper,
because somehow this via control,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/817-2
00:05:58.607 --> 00:06:03.412
<v Seungweon Park>you know what is the other OD for to
shell they are using it.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/817-3
00:06:03.412 --> 00:06:07.675
<v Seungweon Park>Is that just a regular shell or bash,
org whatever it.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/819-0
00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:07.795
<v Seungweon Park>Is.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/830-0
00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:11.155
<v Seungweon Park>So that you will be really nice.
They can populate the all those</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/830-1
00:06:11.155 --> 00:06:11.675
<v Seungweon Park>environments.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/844-0
00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:16.105
<v Seungweon Park>Variables so that way we don't need to
feed it lengthy.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/851-0
00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:19.025
<v Seungweon Park>One line of a commander,
like a export or something.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/885-0
00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:25.638
<v Seungweon Park>Environment export something environment
and then finally we are running the final</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/885-1
00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:31.613
<v Seungweon Park>you know command line which is really
lengthy even we can chop as the back</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/885-2
00:06:31.613 --> 00:06:37.588
<v Seungweon Park>slash but the in the pipeline they only
show the first line so that is the</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/885-3
00:06:37.588 --> 00:06:38.225
<v Seungweon Park>another.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/892-0
00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:41.035
<v Seungweon Park>Some hard to debug the SM issues.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/896-0
00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:41.945
<v Travis Morgan>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/900-0
00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:43.705
<v Travis Morgan>I hear what you're saying.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/920-0
00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Travis Morgan>Let me let me let me see what we can do
about that one and I can also ask the</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/920-1
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.665
<v Travis Morgan>test automation team here if they've had
that issue.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/939-0
00:06:54.865 --> 00:06:57.195
<v Travis Morgan>And if so,
if there was anything they they were able</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/939-1
00:06:57.195 --> 00:06:58.865
<v Travis Morgan>to do kind of to get to get around it.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/940-0
00:06:59.455 --> 00:07:00.375
<v Seungweon Park>I see. OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/949-0
00:07:01.995 --> 00:07:04.755
<v Seungweon Park>And and also another thing is that the.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/955-0
00:07:07.675 --> 00:07:08.835
<v Seungweon Park>Actually, what was that?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/978-0
00:07:08.915 --> 00:07:12.944
<v Seungweon Park>Oh,
so when we use the set plus E or set</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/978-1
00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:17.464
<v Seungweon Park>minus E,
you know before executing the actual</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/978-2
00:07:17.464 --> 00:07:22.475
<v Seungweon Park>command,
I don't know the the actual do behaviors.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/980-0
00:07:22.515 --> 00:07:24.035
<v Seungweon Park>You know about that kind of?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1016-0
00:07:27.685 --> 00:07:31.123
<v Seungweon Park>Environment so that will be the another
ask,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1016-1
00:07:31.123 --> 00:07:37.387
<v Seungweon Park>but that is there's something you know,
I just the move everything into the shell</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1016-2
00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:41.818
<v Seungweon Park>right now so that that's not the big
issue right now. OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1005-0
00:07:40.005 --> 00:07:40.245
<v Travis Morgan>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1016-3
00:07:41.818 --> 00:07:47.165
<v Seungweon Park>And then next one is the you know the
first one actually we create I.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1031-0
00:07:47.155 --> 00:07:52.805
<v Seungweon Park>I noticed that that there is a AHA ticket
for that, but that is the snapshot.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1036-0
00:07:53.595 --> 00:07:54.395
<v Seungweon Park>I would say so.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1043-0
00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:57.903
<v Seungweon Park>Similar to that, but you really,
really nice to have this kind of a</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1043-1
00:07:57.903 --> 00:07:58.315
<v Seungweon Park>comment.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1055-0
00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:02.185
<v Seungweon Park>Like instance clone from the V rang
number.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1065-0
00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:07.115
<v Seungweon Park>I mean the template name because once we
create the the V rack which we are</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1065-1
00:08:07.115 --> 00:08:07.625
<v Seungweon Park>working.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1075-0
00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:13.715
<v Seungweon Park>With a gateway and then you know the LRU.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1095-0
00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:18.031
<v Seungweon Park>Then instead of,
you know creating the V rack all the time,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1095-1
00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:22.235
<v Seungweon Park>we just have a final or some golden
version of the V rack.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1109-0
00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:27.274
<v Seungweon Park>And then we can just span off and then
there will be the, you know, safer.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1109-1
00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:29.155
<v Seungweon Park>And we're so faster when we.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1113-0
00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:31.025
<v Seungweon Park>Creating the new vrack.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1135-0
00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:37.984
<v Seungweon Park>So I'm hoping that they can, you know,
implemented this one with a higher</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1135-1
00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:41.155
<v Seungweon Park>priority in the next quarter.
There will be the.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1141-0
00:08:43.275 --> 00:08:44.795
<v Seungweon Park>My you know, thumbs up.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1149-0
00:08:44.355 --> 00:08:49.555
<v Travis Morgan>Well, yeah.
I I I see how to say this like I think.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1159-0
00:08:51.025 --> 00:08:54.958
<v Travis Morgan>What you're asking for here is you've
explained it clearly and and the value of</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1159-1
00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:55.105
<v Travis Morgan>it.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1177-0
00:08:56.825 --> 00:09:02.025
<v Travis Morgan>We we have the multi orbit team has asked
for something very similar to to this.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1214-0
00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:07.145
<v Travis Morgan>This is their main like ask now is is.
Is there a way that we can make it so</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1214-1
00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:12.464
<v Travis Morgan>that we can get these spun up quicker and
then the last meeting that I had with</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1194-0
00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:09.725
<v Seungweon Park>Yeah.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1214-2
00:09:12.464 --> 00:09:15.456
<v Travis Morgan>Chris.
He also said he thought that this was</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1214-3
00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:16.985
<v Travis Morgan>should be our our next.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1217-0
00:09:17.905 --> 00:09:18.505
<v Travis Morgan>Big priority.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1222-0
00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:20.015
<v Travis Morgan>For the for the product.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1221-0
00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:19.715
<v Seungweon Park>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1225-0
00:09:21.355 --> 00:09:21.475
<v Seungweon Park>Yep.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1244-0
00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:27.573
<v Travis Morgan>So it's definitely like like it's it's
been on the road map for a long time and</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1244-1
00:09:27.573 --> 00:09:28.025
<v Travis Morgan>it is.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1252-0
00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:31.985
<v Travis Morgan>I think it's moving up to the to the top
of the request list.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1255-0
00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:33.185
<v Seungweon Park>OK.</v>

00:09:42.745 --> 00:09:46.849
<v Travis Morgan>I I go in the Pi planning and I I always
think it's going to be this thing that we</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1312-1
00:09:46.849 --> 00:09:50.904

<v Travis Morgan>survey to to the engineering managers
asking.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1343-0
00:10:02.985 --> 00:10:04.225

<v Travis Morgan>So she can probably just take this and
put that in the survey and then that will</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1388-1
00:10:16.853 --> 00:10:21.156

<v Seungweon Park>my pipeline is has a some flaws or
something so.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1537-0
00:11:18.085 --> 00:11:18.405
<v Travis Morgan>It.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1567-0
00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:22.656
<v Travis Morgan>Well,
definitely the the the YAML files that</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1567-1
00:11:22.656 --> 00:11:26.446
<v Travis Morgan>you're generating.
If you can give us copies of those,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1567-2
00:11:26.446 --> 00:11:31.475
<v Travis Morgan>I'd like to see if we can recreate the
problem and analyze them because.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1561-0
00:11:27.995 --> 00:11:28.395

00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:34.745
<v Travis Morgan>It it could be a bug with the product.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1610-0
00:11:34.745 --> 00:11:37.522
<v Travis Morgan>Sometimes it's not with the virtual rack
product,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1610-1
00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:42.243
<v Travis Morgan>but with our LMS system and we have to go
talk to the loading team and be like, hey,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1610-2
00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:46.408
<v Travis Morgan>this is a way that people are loading
stuff on racks now, can you help us,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1610-3
00:11:46.408 --> 00:11:48.185
<v Travis Morgan>you know, fix this and and then?</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1613-0
00:11:48.185 --> 00:11:48.825
<v Travis Morgan>Sometimes it's just like.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1626-0
00:11:50.415 --> 00:11:54.039
<v Travis Morgan>Like like there's something missing from
the file and you put in there and</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1626-1
00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:55.295
<v Travis Morgan>suddenly everything works.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1644-0
00:11:55.295 --> 00:11:58.639
<v Travis Morgan>So like if you can send those to us,
we'll we'll do a deep dive into the files</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1643-0
00:11:58.285 --> 00:11:58.805
<v Seungweon Park>OK.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1644-1
00:11:58.639 --> 00:11:59.655
<v Travis Morgan>and try to reproduce it.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1656-0
00:11:59.165 --> 00:12:03.525
<v Seungweon Park>Yeah, yeah, already.
I talked to the Eric Sulli about this</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1656-1
00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:04.485
<v Seungweon Park>issue before.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1687-0
00:12:04.485 --> 00:12:09.443
<v Seungweon Park>But what he's saying is that LMS will,
you know, automatically, you know,</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1658-0
00:12:05.185 --> 00:12:05.385
<v Travis Morgan>Mm hmm.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1687-1
00:12:09.443 --> 00:12:14.870
<v Seungweon Park>they gonna load all those component or
whatever is in the you know the component</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1687-2
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.205
<v Seungweon Park>list.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1692-0
00:12:15.205 --> 00:12:18.765
<v Seungweon Park>But I noticed that recently, not recently.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1711-0
00:12:18.765 --> 00:12:23.525
<v Seungweon Park>I don't know when they changed the those
Yammer file format so that we used to use</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1711-1
00:12:23.525 --> 00:12:25.245
<v Seungweon Park>the Yammer file for the V RAG.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1715-0
00:12:26.105 --> 00:12:27.505
<v Seungweon Park>You know deployment.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1728-0

00:12:31.495 --> 00:12:36.135
<v Seungweon Park>But somehow they unite here as a single
fire pitch.</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1797-0
00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:41.491
<v Seungweon Park>Include all those component so that we
don't use the adjacent file in the latest</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1797-1
00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:44.361
<v Seungweon Park>one,
but they have a backward compatibility</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1797-2
00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:45.405

00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:50.399
<v Seungweon Park>I was curious, you know,
because of the latest change 'cause that</v>

1c97f8d8-4a68-4dd0-ad98-73bd2466207f/1811-1
00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:51.405
