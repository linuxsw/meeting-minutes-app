# Transcript Preview Fix Implementation

This document details the updated fix for the transcript preview functionality in the Meeting Minutes App.

## Issue Fixed

The transcript preview was only displaying the last line of the transcript instead of showing the full content. This was due to a potential issue with how the transcript segments array was being manipulated during the sort operation.

## Implementation Details

The fix was implemented in the `src/app/processing/page.tsx` file:

1. Created a new array copy before sorting and mapping to prevent potential mutation issues:

```typescript
{/* Create a new array to avoid modifying the original */}
{[...transcript.segments]
  .sort((a, b) => a.startTime - b.startTime) // Ensure chronological order
  .map((segment, index) => {
    const speaker = transcript.speakers.find((s) => s.id === segment.speakerId);
    return (
      <div key={segment.id || index} className="pb-2 border-b border-gray-100 last:border-0">
        <span className="font-semibold text-black">{speaker?.name || 'Unknown'}:</span>{' '}
        <span className="text-black">{segment.text}</span>
      </div>
    );
  })}
```

The key change is using the spread operator `[...transcript.segments]` to create a new array before sorting, which ensures the original array is not modified and all segments are properly displayed.

## Button Styling Consistency

In addition to fixing the transcript preview, we've also addressed button styling consistency throughout the application:

1. Updated the button component in `src/components/ui/button.tsx` to explicitly set text colors:
   - Default and destructive variants now explicitly use white text
   - All other variants explicitly use black text

2. Created a comprehensive `BUTTON_STYLING_GUIDE.md` document that explains:
   - Available button variants and their usage
   - How to customize button colors using CSS variables
   - Best practices for maintaining consistent styling

## Testing

The fix ensures that all transcript content is properly displayed with good readability. Users can now see the entire transcript with proper scrolling functionality and improved visual styling.

All buttons throughout the application now have consistent text colors that ensure good contrast and readability.

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any edge cases in transcript parsing
2. Consider adding additional customization options for button styling
3. Implement the "Add Participants" functionality for the final meeting minutes generation
