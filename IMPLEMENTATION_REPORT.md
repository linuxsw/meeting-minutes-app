# Meeting Minutes App - Implementation Report

## Overview

This report documents the implementation of all requested improvements to the Meeting Minutes App, including MIME type support, UI/UX enhancements, speaker management, and OpenAI integration.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Extended MIME Type Support
- Added support for `.doc` and `.docx` file extensions
- Properly mapped file extensions to correct MIME types:
  - `.vtt` → `text/vtt`
  - `.srt` → `application/x-subrip`
  - `.txt` → `text/plain`
  - `.doc` → `application/msword`
  - `.docx` → `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`

### 2. UI State Persistence
- Fixed "Back to Template Selection" button to preserve:
  - Uploaded transcript file
  - Selected tab (Video+Transcript, Video Only, or Transcript Only)
- Implemented session storage for file persistence across navigation
- Added state management to maintain UI selections throughout the workflow

### 3. Dynamic Speaker Management
- Replaced sample attendees (John Smith, etc.) with actual speakers from transcript
- Added functionality to manually add participants to the attendee list
- Implemented speaker merging that persists when navigating back
- Added "Reset Speakers" button to revert to original transcript speakers

### 4. OpenAI Integration
- Updated OpenAI provider to use the user's real API key
- Implemented actual API calls to OpenAI with fallback to mock responses
- Added support for different transcript types and meeting templates
- Ensured robust error handling for API failures

## Testing Results

### Transcript File Support
- Successfully tested upload and processing of `.vtt`, `.txt`, `.doc`, and `.docx` files
- Verified that file content is correctly parsed regardless of format
- Confirmed that uploaded files persist when navigating between screens

### UI Navigation and State Persistence
- Verified that "Back to Template Selection" preserves uploaded files
- Confirmed that tab selection (Transcript Only, etc.) is maintained
- Tested that merged speakers and edited speaker names persist through navigation

### Speaker Management
- Confirmed that actual transcript speakers are used as attendees
- Verified that the "Reset Speakers" button restores original speakers
- Tested adding and removing attendees manually

### OpenAI Integration
- Tested with both provided transcript files:
  - "[Discussion]VRack Infrastructure + vrackctl.vtt"
  - "1_1 Seungweon_Michael.vtt"
- Compared results with and without AI processing
- Verified that the application handles API errors gracefully

## Conclusion

All requested improvements have been successfully implemented and tested. The Meeting Minutes App now provides:

1. Comprehensive file format support
2. Robust UI state persistence
3. Dynamic speaker management with merge and reset capabilities
4. Integrated OpenAI processing with fallback mechanisms

The application is now ready for production use with both AI and non-AI processing options available.
