# Transcript Preview Fix

This document details the fixes implemented for the transcript preview functionality in the Meeting Minutes App.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Transcript Preview Display**: Fixed the issue where only the last line of the transcript was being displayed instead of the full content.
2. **Text Styling**: Improved text styling with black font for better readability.
3. **Scrolling Functionality**: Added proper scrolling functionality to navigate through the full transcript.

## Implementation Details

The main changes were made in the `src/app/processing/page.tsx` file:

1. Added explicit chronological sorting of transcript segments:
   ```typescript
   const sortedSegments = [...segments].sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start)
   setTranscriptSegments(sortedSegments)
   ```

2. Fixed the rendering loop to properly map through and display all segments:
   ```typescript
   {transcriptSegments.map((segment, index) => (
     <div key={index || `segment-${index}`} className="border-b pb-2">
       <div className="font-medium text-gray-900">{segment.speaker}:</div>
       <div className="text-gray-900">{segment.text}</div>
     </div>
   ))}
   ```

3. Enhanced text styling for better readability:
   ```typescript
   <div className="font-medium text-gray-900">{segment.speaker}:</div>
   <div className="text-gray-900">{segment.text}</div>
   ```

4. Added proper scrolling container:
   ```typescript
   <div className="h-96 overflow-y-auto border rounded-lg p-4 space-y-3">
     {/* Transcript segments rendering */}
   </div>
   ```

5. Added segment count display for verification:
   ```typescript
   <div className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">
     Total segments: {transcriptSegments.length}
   </div>
   ```

## Speaker Card Improvements

Additionally, the speaker cards in the drag-and-drop interface were improved:

1. Better visual styling with improved contrast
2. Enhanced text formatting for better readability
3. Clear visual cues for draggable elements

## Testing

The fix ensures that all transcript content is properly displayed with good readability, rather than just showing the last line. Users can now see the entire transcript with proper scrolling functionality.
