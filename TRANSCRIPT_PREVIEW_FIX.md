# Transcript Preview and Attendee Section Fixes

This document details the fixes implemented for the transcript preview and attendee section functionality in the Meeting Minutes App.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Transcript Preview Display**: Fixed the issue where only the last line of the transcript was being displayed instead of the full content.
2. **Text Styling**: Improved text styling with black font for better readability.
3. **Scrolling Functionality**: Enhanced the scrolling container to properly display all transcript content.
4. **Speaker Card Styling**: Improved the visual appearance of speaker cards with better contrast.

## Implementation Details

The main changes were made in the `src/app/processing/page.tsx` file:

1. Added explicit chronological sorting of transcript segments:
   ```typescript
   transcript.segments
     .sort((a, b) => a.startTime - b.startTime) // Ensure chronological order
     .map((segment, index) => {
       // Rendering logic
     })
   ```

2. Enhanced text styling for better readability:
   ```typescript
   <span className="font-semibold text-black">{speaker?.name || 'Unknown'}:</span>{' '}
   <span className="text-black">{segment.text}</span>
   ```

3. Improved the speaker card styling:
   ```typescript
   <div className="border rounded-md p-4 bg-white shadow-sm">
     {/* Speaker card content */}
   </div>
   ```

4. Added segment count display for verification:
   ```typescript
   <div className="mt-2 text-xs text-gray-500">
     {transcript?.segments?.length || 0} segments in transcript
   </div>
   ```

## Testing

The fix ensures that all transcript content is properly displayed with good readability, rather than just showing the last line. Users can now see the entire transcript with proper scrolling functionality and improved visual styling.

The attendee section in the result page has also been verified to properly display merged speakers and include the "Add Participants" button functionality.
