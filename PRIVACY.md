Privacy Policy for Meeting Minutes Application (Proof of Concept)

Effective Date: May 11, 2025

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Meeting Minutes Application ("the Application") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our services. This application is a proof-of-concept and is not intended for production use with sensitive personal data until further security and privacy measures are implemented.

2. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

    Audio Recordings: The primary data processed by the application are audio recordings of meetings. These recordings may contain voices, discussions, and other sounds present during the meeting.
    Transcription Data: The application transcribes the audio recordings into text format. This text includes the spoken words from the meeting.
    Speaker Identification Data (Optional): If you utilize speaker identification features, the application may process voice characteristics to distinguish between different speakers in the audio recording. This may involve creating temporary voiceprints or speaker embeddings.
    User-Provided Information: This may include meeting titles, dates, attendee names (if manually entered), and any notes or summaries generated by the user.
    Usage Data: We may collect information about how you use the application, such as features accessed, time spent on the platform, and error reports. This data is anonymized and used for improving the application.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

    To Provide Core Functionality: The primary purpose is to transcribe audio recordings of meetings and assist in generating meeting minutes. This includes features like speaker identification and potentially summarization (if implemented).
    To Improve Our Services: We analyze usage patterns and feedback to improve the application's features, performance, and user experience. This analysis is performed on anonymized and aggregated data.
    To Communicate With You: We may use your contact information (if provided) to respond to your inquiries, provide support, and inform you about updates or changes to the application.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

    With Third-Party Services (If Applicable): If the application integrates with third-party services (e.g., cloud storage, AI processing services), we will clearly disclose this. Data shared with these services is governed by their respective privacy policies. We strive to minimize data sharing and only use services with strong privacy commitments.
    Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

6. Data Retention

We retain your data only for as long as necessary to provide you with the services and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the application, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes. The specific retention period will vary depending on the nature of the information and the reasons for its collection.
